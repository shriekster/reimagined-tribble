### **Objective**

Build a **Scalable E-commerce Platform** with the following features:

1. **Architecture** to handle product management, order processing, and user management.
2. **Real-time notifications** for order updates.
3. **Search and filter functionality** using an external search engine.
4. **Optimized performance** with caching and asynchronous processing.

### **Requirements**

#### **Core Functionalities**

1. **User Management Service**:

   - User registration and authentication (JWT or OAuth2).
   - Role-based access control (e.g., admin, customer).

2. **Product Service**:

   - CRUD operations for products.
   - Support for product categories, tags, and images.
   - Search and filter products by name, category, and price using **Elasticsearch** or another search engine.

3. **Order Service**:

   - Place, view, and cancel orders.
   - Real-time order status updates (WebSockets or Server-Sent Events).
   - Integration with a payment gateway (mock implementation is sufficient).

4. **Notification Service**:

   - Send email notifications (e.g., order confirmation).
   - Push notifications for real-time updates.

5. **Analytics**:
   - Capture and display sales data, including:
     - Total revenue.
     - Most purchased products.
     - Orders per user.

---

#### **Frontend Requirements (React)**

- **Pages**:

  1. **Home**: Display featured products and categories.
  2. **Product Catalog**: Search, filter, and view product listings.
  3. **Product Details**: Detailed view of a single product.
  4. **Cart and Checkout**: Add items to the cart and place an order.
  5. **User Dashboard**:
     - For customers: View order history and track orders.
     - For admins: Manage products, view analytics, and process orders.

- **Features**:
  1. Responsive and user-friendly UI.
  2. Use Redux, Zustand, or Context API for state management.
  3. Use TypeScript for type safety.
  4. Implement lazy loading and code-splitting for performance.

---

#### **Backend Requirements (Node.js)**

- **Architecture**:

  - Implement a **architecture**:
    - **User Service**: Manages user accounts and roles.
    - **Product Service**: Handles product data.
    - **Order Service**: Processes orders and handles payments.
    - **Notification Service**: Sends emails and push notifications.

- **Data Persistence**:

  - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
  - Use a document-based database (e.g., MongoDB) for products or analytics if needed.

- **Event-Driven Communication**:

  - Use **message queues** like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Streams for inter-service communication (e.g., notifying the notification service when an order is placed).

- **Real-Time Functionality**:

  - Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for real-time order updates.

- **Caching**:

  - Implement caching for frequently accessed endpoints using Redis.

- **Search**:
  - Integrate **Elasticsearch** to enable full-text search and filtering.

---

#### **Advanced Features**

1. **Distributed Tracing**:

   - Use tools like Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for monitoring inter-service communication.

2. **Rate Limiting**:

   - Implement rate limiting for APIs using libraries like `express-rate-limit` or Redis.

3. **Security**:

   - Protect sensitive endpoints with role-based access control.
   - Use HTTPS and secure sensitive data (e.g., encrypt user passwords with bcrypt).

4. **Scalability**:
   - Dockerize all services and provide a `docker-compose.yml` for local setup.
   - Use Kubernetes (optional) for orchestration.

---

### **Bonus Features**

1. **Frontend**:

   - Implement a progressive web app (PWA) for offline access.

2. **DevOps**:

   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
   - Deploy to a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
   - Monitor application performance with Prometheus and Grafana.

3. **Backend**:

   - Implement a recommendation system (e.g., "Users also bought" suggestions).
   - Create a webhook system to notify external systems of significant events (e.g., order placement).

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all services (Jest or Mocha).
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints.

---

### **Deliverables**

1. **GitHub Repository**:

   - A `README.md` explaining:
     - How to run each service locally.
     - API documentation (e.g., using Swagger or Postman).
     - DB stucture file.

2. **Live Demo** (optional):
   - Deploy the app to a cloud platform.
   - Provide a link to access the application.
   - Provide a link to access the DB.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **System Design**:

   - Adherence to microservices principles.
   - Proper use of asynchronous and event-driven communication.

2. **Code Quality**:

   - Clean, modular, and testable code.
   - Effective use of TypeScript (if implemented).

3. **Performance**:
   - Efficient database queries and caching.
   - Scalability and fault tolerance.
